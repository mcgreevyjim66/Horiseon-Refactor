# HORISEON-Refactor

## Description

An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for business; for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website. Because of this, this project was undertaken to update the existing HTML and CSS code to ensure that the web site is as accessible as can with with current standards and practices. The project will "refactor" the exisitng Horiseon prject HTML with current sematic HTML tages that support accessibility processing. During this project I learned to importance of inclusing accessibility processing into web sites as well as how make better use of CSS by consoldating redundent clasess.
